I am a computational physicist interested in understanding the divide between living and non-living matter. I currently work as a postdoc in the group of [Andela Šarić](http://https://andelasaric.com) at the [Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA)](https://ist.ac.at/en/home/), where I develop toy-models and coarse-grained computer simulations to study the emergence of life-like functionalities from the molecular to the cellular scale.

During my PhD, I designed a minimal catalyst using programmable matter under the supervision of [Zorana Zeravcic](https://zzorana.wixsite.com/lifeinajar) and [Olivier Rivoire](http://statbio.net/) at [ESPCI Paris](https://www.espci.psl.eu/en/). I also studied the folding of short colloidal polymer chains in collaboration with the group of [Jasna Brujic](https://wp.nyu.edu/brujiclab/). You can read my PhD thesis [here](https://www.theses.fr/2022UPSLS036).
