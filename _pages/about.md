I am a postdoc in the group of [Andela Šarić](http://https://andelasaric.com/) at the [Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA)](https://ist.ac.at/en/home/), where I study the origin of the cellular organization in eukaryotes using coarse-grained Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations.

I did my PhD under the supervision of [Zorana Zeravcic](https://zzorana.wixsite.com/lifeinajar) and [Olivier Rivoire](http://statbio.net/) at [ESPCI Paris](https://www.espci.psl.eu/en/), where I worked on designing a minimal catalyst using programmable matter. I also studied the folding of short colloidal polymer chains in collaboration with [Jasna Brujic](https://wp.nyu.edu/brujiclab/) and Angus McMullen. You can read my PhD thesis [here](https://www.theses.fr/2022UPSLS036).
